# Project Readme: Dynamic Population Pyramids
## Project Overview
This project, "Plotting Dynamic Population Pyramids," provides scripts and methodologies for creating interactive population pyramids using various data analysis and visualization tools, namely R, Python, Stata, SPSS, and Excel. Each tool's script is designed to take demographic data and transform it into a dynamic, visual representation of the population's age and sex distribution.

## Getting Started
To use these codes, you should have a basic understanding of the respective programming languages and software. Ensure you have the required software and libraries installed on your computer:

- R: Install the latest version of R and RStudio. Required packages include ggplot2 and plotly for interactive visualizations.
- Python: Ensure you have Python installed, along with data analysis libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. plotly or bokeh can be used for interactive charts.
- Stata: A valid installation of Stata is required. Familiarity with Stata's graphical commands will be beneficial.
- SPSS: SPSS software should be installed, and the script provided utilizes built-in SPSS charting capabilities.
- Excel: A recent version of Microsoft Excel with the capability to add and manipulate pivot charts.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by folders corresponding to each software tool:
- /Code/R: Contains R scripts for generating population pyramids.
- /Code/Python: Contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with code and visualizations.
- /Code/Stata: Includes .do files for Stata.
- /Code/SPSS: Contains syntax files for SPSS.
- /Code/Excel: Includes Excel workbooks with example data and pivot chart setup.
